# raylib-wasm

This is a boilerplate project for creating games using the raylib library. It includes a basic structure and some examples of how to use raylib in your code. 

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have the following installed on your system:

- GCC as your C/C++ compiler
- The raylib library
- Docker

Once you have these dependencies installed, you can start the developing your game as usual. Just keep in mind that `main.cpp` will always be the entrypoint. You can build for web without any configuration. You only need to run the `emscripten build project` task in VSCode.

## Next Features

- [ ] Support for Windows and MacOs
- [ ] Fully contained development environment
- [ ] Support for multiple raylib versions
- [ ] Extensive error handling
- [ ] Support for another IDE's
